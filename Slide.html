    <p>
        I was letting go of Atlanta,
        <br> then you held on to me
        <br><br>Said I wanted slow, 
        <br>but my heart's impulsive
        <br>All I want is all of you
        <br><br>Wait a second
        <br>Stop staring
        <br>Go ahead and kiss me
        <br><br>My mind's on you all day
        <br>I blame it on you
        <br><br>You say, "Slide?"
        <br>I say, "I'm ready to go."
        <br>Well, I'm out the door
        <br><br>The weight's in my chest
        <br>My body's in space
        <br>free falling
        <br><br>Night's all gone
        <br>You took my gaze away
        <br>Time, please go the other way
        <br><br>It seems so clear, 
        <br>but my mind's a blur
        <br>What is wrong with me?
        <br><br>Don't wanna be too close
        <br>Scared you're gonna go
        <br><br>You say, "Slide?"
        <br>I say, "I'm ready to go."
        <br>Well, I'm out the door
        <br>My time's all yours
        <br>But where did you go?
        <br><br>But where did you go?
        <br>But where did you go?
        <br>But where did you go?
        <br>Ohhhhh~
        <br><br>You say, "Slide?"
        <br>I say, "I'm ready to go."
        <br>Well, I'm out the door
        <br>My time's all yours
        <br> Well, I miss you more...
